# yearbook-scripts

Scripts to help generate the Raise yearbook.

The main problem this solves is taking all the images and standardizing their size, format and aspect ratios.

You should still go through all the content as a human and ensure it's appropriate to publish.

## Usage:

These scripts are generally optimized for use on macOS and Linux.

1. Install [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/)
2. Place images in the [`input`](./input/) folder
3. Run [`./convert.sh`](./convert.sh)
4. See output images in the [`output`](./output/) folder
